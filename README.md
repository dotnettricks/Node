### Token-Based Authentication In Node.js Using JWT
In this post we are going to learn about JSON Web Tokens (JWT), and know how to create a token by using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) on user authentication to secure NodeJS API’s. All we are going to creating a new sample application using Express-generator, then modify the application to create a token using JWT to verify user access for API’s. Let’s start the talk about getting an overview on authentication.

### Authentication and Authorization in Node.js
Previously we have learned how to create JSON Web Token (JWT) by demo login data, passed through request header to verify user by using middleware. Before starting with this post it’s recommended to overview previous post on ” Token-Based Authentication In Node.js Using JWT”.In this article, we are going to learn how to perform user authentication using “Passport” then create JWT token to verify user with access permission on each request. We are going to use MSSQL server for database operations. Previously we have tested the sample application using postman, in this post we are going to configure handlebars as view engine to prepare user interface for user operations.
